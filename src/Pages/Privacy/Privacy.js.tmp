  <p>We at TopShelf Equity Partners LLC (“TopShelf,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) created this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared. This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of TopShelf in connection with our online services (the “Services”), which are made available to you through our website located at <a href="https://www.topshelfequitypartners.com">https://www.topshelfequitypartners.com</a> (the “Site”).</p>
  <p>We strive to educate parents and kids about how to appropriately safeguard their privacy when using our Services. We are committed to complying with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (“COPPA”), which requires us to inform parents and legal guardians about our information collection and use practices. COPPA also requires that we obtain parental consent before we allow children under the age of 13 to access and/or use our Services. We urge kids to check with their parents before entering information through our Site and/or Services, and we recommend that parents discuss with their kids restrictions regarding the online release of Personal Information (as defined below) to anyone they don’t know.</p>
  <p>By visiting our Site and/or using our Services, or by permitting your child to use our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use.

  <p><strong>Personal Information</strong></p>
  <p>We do not collect any personal information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us.</p>
  <p>When you sign up to become a user of the Site (a “User”), you will be asked to provide us with certain personal information, such as your first name, last name, and email address. In this Privacy Policy, we refer to this information as “Personal Information.” Other than the online contact information required to obtain parental consent, we do not collect any Personal Information from Users under the age of 13 unless the User’s parent or legal guardian has first provided us with consent for that User to use the Services and disclose Personal Information to us. If you are a User under the age of 13, please do not send any Personal Information to us if we have not obtained prior consent from your parent or guardian. If we learn we have collected Personal Information from a User under the age of 13 without parental consent, or if we learn a User under the age of 13 has provided us Personal Information beyond what we request from him or her, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a User under the age of 13 may have provided us Personal Information in violation of this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:Privacy@topshelfequitypartners.com">privacy@topshelfequitypartners.com</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Usage Information</strong></p>
  <p>Like most websites, we use automatic data collection technology when you visit the Site to record information that identifies your computer, to track your use of our Site, and to collect certain basic information about you and your surfing habits.

  <p>We collect this Usage Information by using cookies and pixel tags (also called web beacons or clear gifs). Cookies are small packets of data that a website stores on your computer’s hard drive so that your computer will “remember” information about your visit. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of website users. You can reject cookies by following the directions provided in your Internet provider’s “help” file. If you reject cookies, you may still visit the Site, but may not be able to use some areas of the Site and/or the Services.</p>
  <p>We do not collect Personal Information in this way, but if you’ve provided us with Personal Information, we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers.</p>
